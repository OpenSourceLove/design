* just the icon [to be used as favicon, buttons (like Eduardo mentioned) or stickers
* icon + type [to be used elsewhere, like page header/footer, other sites that might link to this project]
  — having the type is also helpful at the first time a person sees it, as it is the actual name of the project
  — there still can be some cases where it is ok to just use the type without the icon, so it's always nice to have
* single-color [to be used in too dark or too bright background scenarios (see how github uses the single-color octocat in the footer although they have a colored version too -> :octocat: ) ]
